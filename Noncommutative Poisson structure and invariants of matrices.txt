Abstract. We introduce a novel approach that employs techniques from non-commutative Poisson geometry to comprehend the algebra of invariants oftwo n × n matrices.We entirely solve the open problem of computing thealgebra of invariants of two 4 × 4 matrices. As an application, we derive thecomplete description of the invariant commuting variety of 4 × 4 matrices andthe fourth Calogero-Moser space.
1. Introduction
In the realm of algebraic geometry, there exists a categorical equivalence be-tween aﬃne schemes and commutative algebras. Many geometric structures onaﬃne schemes can be algebraically described, and conversely. However, this corre-spondence is not applicable to associative algebras.Kontsevich and Rosenberg proposed a heuristic principle to explore noncommu-tative geometry on associative algebras, which may not necessarily be commuta-tive [23]. This principle can be broadly summarized: for an associative algebra Aover C, any noncommutative geometric structure—such as noncommutative Pois-son, noncommutative symplectic, etc.—should naturally induce its classical coun-terpart on the aﬃne variety Repn(A) classifying all representations of A on Cn, forevery n ∈N.Crawley-Boevey introduced an H0-Poisson structure on any associative alge-bra [6].Essentially, it is a bilinear bracket on A which, in turn, induces a Liebracket on the commutator quotient space A♮:= A/[A, A]. This structure alignswith the KR principle.More precisely, let C[Repn(A)] be the coordinate ringof Repn(A). The natural trace map
Trn(A): A♮→C[Repn(A)] ,¯a →[ρ 7→Tr ρ(a)](1.1)
sends the elements of A♮to functions on Repn(A). The image of Trn(A) lies in thesubalgebra C[Repn(A)]GLn which represents the coordinate ring of the charactervariety Repn(A)//GLn. Then the main result of [6] states that if A possesses aH0-Poisson structure then there is a unique Poisson bracket on C[Repn(A)]GLn sothat the trace map (1.1) is a Lie algebra homomorphism. Equivalently, the algebrahomomorphism induced from (1.1)
Sym Trn(A): Sym(A♮) →C[Repn(A)]GLn(1.2)
is a Poisson homomorphism.Let Mn be the vector space of n × n matrices over the ﬁeld C.Consider apositive integer d and the action of the general linear group GLn(C) on the direct

product Mdn of d copies of Mn by simultaneous conjugation. This action sends a d-tuple (X1, . . . , Xd) to another d-tuple (gX1g−1, . . . , gXdg−1) for any g ∈GLn(C).Consequently, this action induces an action of GLn on the algebra C[Mdn], rep-resenting polynomial functions on Mdn. One of the fundamental questions in in-variant theory revolves around describing the generators and relations of the alge-bra Cnd := C[Mdn]GLn. A well-known result by Procesi [31] and Razmyslov [32]states that Cnd is generated by trace functions and the algebraic relations be-tween them are derived from the Cayley-Hamilton theorem. Let us provide thefollowing, more algebraic, interpretation of this result.Consider the free alge-bra R := C⟨x1, ..., xd⟩on d generators. Then each point X := (X1, ..., Xd) ∈Mdncan be uniquely determined by the representation
ρX : R →Mn ,xi 7→Xi
and two representations ρX and ρY are isomorphic if and only if X and Y lie inthe same GLn-orbit. Consequently, we have the equivalence
Cnd ∼= C[Repn(R)]GLn ,
and the Procesi-Razmyslov result can be interpreted as the map in (1.2) beinga surjective homomorphism.Thus, if R has an H0-Poisson structure, the mapin (1.2) becomes a surjective Poisson homomorphism. Consequently, describing thealgebra Cnd is equivalent to providing a description of the kernel of Sym Trn(R),which forms a Poisson ideal of Sym(R♮).Let us discuss the H0-Poisson structure proposed by Kontsevich on the freealgebra with an even number of generators and the corresponding Lie algebrahomomorphism. To this end, we utilize the quiver realization of a free algebra.Let Q = (I, H) be a ﬁnite quiver, where I is the set of vertices and H is the setof edges. For α ∈NI, we deﬁne the space of representations of Q of dimensionvector α to be the vector space of matrices
Rep(Q, α) =M
h∈HMat(αh0 × αh1, C) ,
where h0 and h1 are the head and tail of an edge h. The group G(α) = Q GLαi(C)acts on Rep(Q, α) by conjugation, and the quotient space Rep(Q, α)/G(α) repre-sents isomorphism classes of such representations. Recall that the double quiver Qis deﬁned by adding a reverse edge a∗for each a ∈H. Then there is a naturalidentiﬁcation of Rep(Q, α) with the cotangent bundle T ∗Rep(Q, α).The latterhas a canonical symplectic structure, which via the symplectic reduction construc-tion [25], induces a symplectic structure on T ∗Rep(Q, α)//G(α).This, in turn,induces a Poisson bracket on the algebra C[Rep(Q, α)]G(α).In [22], Kontsevich deﬁned an inﬁnite-dimensional Lie algebra structure on thevector space CQ♮, where CQ is the path algebra of Q. He showed that the map
Trα(Q): CQ♮→C[Rep(Q, α)]G(α)(1.3)
is a Lie algebra homomorphism for all α ∈NI.Let Q be the quiver with onevertex and k edges-loops. Then, the path algebra CQ is isomorphic to the freealgebra C⟨x1, . . . , xk, y1, . . . , yk⟩. The vector space V = span(x1, . . . , xk, y1, . . . , yk)has a canonical symplectic form ω:
Then, the Kontsevich Lie bracket on CQ♮is deﬁned as follows:
{u1 · · · up, v1 · · · vq} =X
1≤i≤p1≤j≤q
ω(ui, vj)ui+1 · · · upu1 · · · ui−1vj+1 · · · vqv1 · · · vj−1,
(1.4)where the elements u1, . . . , up, v1, . . . , vq ∈{x1, ..., xk, y1, ..., yk}.As mentionedabove, the map (1.3) allows to compute the Poisson bracket on Cnd for d = 2k. Forinstance, the explicit Poisson bracket on C32 was described this way by Normatovand Turdibaev [29].The problem of identifying a minimal generating set of Cnd and ﬁnding the exactrelations among these generators still remains unsolved. Several noteworthy resultsin this area have been attained thus far and explicit descriptions were found foronly C2m for all positive integers m, C32 and C33. The main method utilized isbased on the work of Abeasis and Pittaluga [1], using the representation theory ofsymmetric and general linear groups. They employed this approach in a mannerreminiscent of its application in the theory of PI-algebras. Their method ﬁnds theminimal set of generators as a result of a decomposition of a certain module intoirreducible components.The next goal was to give the description of C42. Drensky and Sadikova [11]discovered the existence of a minimal generating set whose span forms a semisimplegraded GL2-module, and they studied its structure. As for the deﬁning relations,it seems that the question remained largely open. To address this, Drensky andLa Scala [10] have devised algorithms based on the representation theory of GL2and conducted calculations using standard Maple functions to determine all deﬁningrelations occurring in degrees 12, 13, and 14.The present paper provides a comprehensive solution to the problem of identify-ing every deﬁning relation with respect to the minimal system of generators of C42in Drensky and Sadikova [11].Unlike previous approaches which were conﬁnedto generating relations within the same degree, our method coming from the non-commutative geometry oﬀers the advantage of a progression from lower to higherdegree relations through the Poisson algebra structure. Remarkably, the highestdegree at which these deﬁning relations appear is 20. Nevertheless, our approachexpedites the procedure, enabling the combinatorial computation to ﬁnalize at de-gree 16 with a partial analysis of bidegree (8, 8) being suﬃcient. We demonstratethat by utilizing the Poisson algebra structure, a mere 8 relations suﬃce to buildthe associative ideal of deﬁning relations, which is generated by 105 polynomials.The insights into how the Poisson structure is eﬀectively harnessed to enhance ourcomputation are given in Subsection 3.6.With all the deﬁning relations of C42 at our disposal, we are confronted withthe task of understanding them. One perspective in invariant theory suggests thefollowing useful way of representing an invariant by its Hironaka decomposition. Itis well-known, that Cnd is Cohen-Macaulay(see [20] and [36]). In other words, thereexists a set of polynomials, called a homogeneous system of parameters or primaryinvariants p1, . . . , pk, such that
Cnd =
sM
i=1qiC[p1, . . . , pk](1.5)
primary invariants were presented by Teranishi [34]. Drensky and La Scala [10]provided some degree bounds for the secondary invariants of C42, but due to anincomplete set of deﬁning relations, the decomposition remained elusive. Now, withthe acquisition of all deﬁning relations of C42, we are able to ﬁnd all the secondaryinvariants presented in Appendix B and thus, the quest of searching an answer ofwhat is an invariant of pairs of 4 × 4 matrices is completed in Subsection 3.10.As an application of our description, we reproved the results of [13] on thedeﬁning relations of the invariant commuting variety of two 4 × 4 matrices andthe fourth Calogero-Moser space. In fact, this can possibly be further extended toobtain more descriptions of other subvarieties embedded into the GIT quotient ofpairs of matrices.Concerning larger matrix sizes, Ðoković [30] presented a minimal generating setconsisting of 173 polynomials for C52 and computed its Hilbert series. However,it is important to note that the form of these polynomials diﬀers from those in [3]and [11], indicating that they might not be well-suited for expressing simple deﬁningrelations. Regarding C62, the current knowledge is limited to the Hilbert series only(see [30]). The methods developed in our work could potentially ﬁnd applicationin resolving these open problems.

2. Preliminaries
We denote by Mn the C-algebra of n × n matrices over the ﬁeld of complexnumbers C.Let d be a positive integer and consider the action of the generallinear group GLn(C) on the direct product Mdn of d copies of Mn by simultaneousconjugation sending a d-tuple (X1, . . . , Xd) to a d-tuple (gX1g−1, . . . , gXdg−1) forany g ∈GLn(C). This action induces an action of GLn on the algebra C[Mdn] ofpolynomial functions on Mdn, i.e. for ϕ ∈C[Mdn] and g ∈GLn:
(g ∗ϕ)(X1, . . . , Xd) = ϕ(g−1X1g, . . . , g−1Xdg).
Note that one can identify Mdn with the aﬃne space Cdn2. In general, the de-scription of the GIT-quotient Mdn//GLn is essentially an open problem of invarianttheory.Given that an algebraic variety V is entirely characterized by its algebra ofpolynomial functions C[V ], our objective is to describe the algebra C[Mdn//GLn].However, by Mumford [26], we can instead study the isomorphic algebra of GLn-invariant polynomials
C[Mdn]GLn = {ϕ ∈C[Mdn] | g ∗ϕ = ϕ, ∀g ∈GLn}.
Traditionally, the algebra of invariants C[Mdn]GLn is denoted by Cnd. Conjecturingthat invariants of matrices of arbitrary sizes are generated by ﬁnitely many tracefunctions, Artin [2] showed that this is indeed the case for invariants of small-sized matrices. Later, the conjecture was independently proven by Razmyslov [32],Procesi [31], Sibirski˘ı [33] and Helling [19].
Theorem 2.1 ([31]). The algebra Cnd is generated over C by all traces of productsof generic matrices Tr(Ai1Ai2 · · · Aij), with j ≤2n −1.
pure or commutative trace algebra. For further background on these algebras werefer to Drensky and Formanek [9].The following result, often called the sec-ond fundamental theorem, aﬃrms that the deﬁning relations are derived from theCayley-Hamilton theorem.
Theorem 2.2 ([32]). All deﬁning relations of the pure trace algebra Cnd over aﬁeld of characteristic zero are consequences of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem.
2.3. Generators and deﬁning relations. Dubnov showed [12] that the only freealgebra among pure trace algebras happens to be the following:
C22 = C[Tr(X), Tr(Y ), Tr(X2), Tr(XY ), Tr(Y 2)].
Moreover, it is known that C23 is a polynomial algebra with a single relation fromthe work of Sibirski˘ı [33] and Formanek [15]. For C2d with d > 2, some polynomialrelations appear among the generators. With a choice of speciﬁc traceless genericmatrices, Drensky [8] is able to give a better presentation of the deﬁning relations.Another reason to change to traceless matrices it due to Procesi [31, Section 5],since there is an isomorphism of Zd-graded algebras:
Cnd ∼= C[u1, u2, . . . , ud] ⊗Cn,d(0),
where Cn,d(0) is the algebra of GLn-invariant polynomial functions on the directproduct of d-tuples of the subspace of traceless n × n matrices. In fact, those ui’sare the traces of generic matrices.For C32, Teranishi [34] proves that if the traces of the following ten words
X, Y, X2, XY, Y 2, X3, X2Y, XY 2, Y 3, X2Y 2(2.1)
are zero, then the value of the trace of any word in generic matrices is also zero.Applying Hilbert theorem, he argues that C32 is integral over the polynomialsubalgebra A in those ten variables and he establishes its Hironaka decomposi-tion C32 = A ⊕Tr(XY X2Y 2)A. Clearly, a deﬁning relation containing the squareof Tr(XY X2Y 2) is eminent and it appears to be quite complicated in the work ofNakamoto [27]. Once again, shifting to the traceless versions
A := X −1
3 Tr(X)I3,B := Y −1
3 Tr(Y )I3
of the generic matrices X and Y , along with replacing the last two generators withthe traces of [A, B]2 and [A, B]3, where throughout the article [A, B] = AB −BA,appears to signiﬁcantly simplify [3] the deﬁning relation.In [34, Proposition 5.2] a set of 17 primary invariants were found by Teranishifor C42. Using the fact that GL2 acts via the standard representation on the two-dimensional space spanned by two generic matrices, Drensky and Sadikova [11]studied the induced GL2-action on C42.They demonstrated the existence of aminimal set of generators that spans a semisimple graded GL2-submodule of C42and list the generators of each simple component. We provide the set of generatorsarranged by degrees in Appendix A. The developed techniques to ﬁnd the deﬁningrelations appear to be quite computationally complicated yielding only in the dis-covery of the low degree relations [10]. Hoge [21] adopted these methods to give apresentation of C33.
2.4. Hilbert Series and Hironaka Decomposition. One of the useful toolsin this study appears to be the usage of the Hilbert series—the formal power se-ries P
consider the simply graded Hilbert series of C42, that is obtained by equalizing thevariables, which in its irreducible form is mentioned in [30, Table 3]: 1 −t2 + t4  1 −t −t3 + t4 + 2t5 + t6 −t7 −t9 + t10
(1 −t)3 (1 −t2)4 (1 −t3)5 (1 −t4)5.(2.2)
Following [30], let us rescale (2.2) by 1 + t2  1 + t + t2  1 + t32 to obtain afraction with the following new numerator
1 + 2 t5 + 2 t6 + 2 t7 + 4 t8 + 4 t9 + 4 t10 + 4 t11 + 2 t12 + 4 t13(2.3)
+4 t14 + 4 t15 + 4 t16 + 2 t17 + 2 t18 + 2 t19 + t24,
and denominator (1 −t)2  1 −t23  1 −t34  1 −t46  1 −t62. This hints at a Hi-ronaka decomposition for C42 with 17 primary and 48 secondary invariants of theircorresponding degrees. A set of 17 primary invariants was presented by Teran-ishi [34] using similar methods he employed for C32. Following the beneﬁcial prac-tice of the usage of traceless versions, we choose the primary invariants to be thetraces of the following:
X, Y
A2, AB, B2
A3, A2B, AB2, B3(2.4)A4, A3B, A2B2, AB3, B4
12[A, B]2, [A, B]2A2, [A, B]2B2.
Only some bounds on degrees of the secondary invariants were suggested in [10]as a consequence of obtaining low degree deﬁning relations. In Subsection 3.10 weexplain how we obtain the set of secondary invariants arranged by their degrees inAppendix B, matching the numerator (2.3).
2.5. Invariant Commuting Variety and Calogero-Moser spaces. Let us con-sider the following subspace of Mn × Mn:
{(X, Y ) ∈Mn × Mn | rank([X, Y ] + In) = 1} .
The GIT quotient of this space with respect to the GLn-action is called the n-th Calogero-Moser space, and it is denoted by Cn.The Calogero-Moser spaceswere studied in detail by Wilson [37] and he proved that Cn is a smooth aﬃneirreducible complex symplectic variety of dimension 2n. These spaces appear tobe of substantial importance in many areas, such as algebraic geometry (Hilbertschemes), deformation theory (symplectic reﬂection algebras), representation the-ory (double aﬃne Hecke algebras) and Poisson geometry. Consequently, there isa strong motivation to obtain a clear and explicit description of their coordinaterings. Since the coordinate ring of Cn is a quotient algebra of Cn2, it is of greatinterest to see the reﬁnement of the fundamental theorems on these spaces.The commuting variety {(X, Y ) ∈Mn × Mn | [X, Y ] = 0} while being inter-esting on its own, its GIT quotient called the n-th invariant commuting variety,which we denote by Comn. It is known that C[Comn] is isomorphic to (C[x, y]⊗n)Sn(see [7] and [35]). Calogero-Moser spaces and invariant commuting varieties appearto share many similarities. It is known that
C[C2]∼=C[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5]/(a24 −a3a5 −1),
C[Com2]∼=C[a1, a2, a3, a4, a5]/(a24 −a3a5)
and for n = 3 the full description is obtained in [28]:
where Iδ is generated by the following ﬁve relations:
r1 = a3a9 −2a4a8 + a5a7,r2 = a5a6 −2a4a7 + a3a8,
r3 = 9δa3 −a3a24 + a23a5 + 6a6a8 −6a27,
r4 = 9δa4 −a34 + a3a4a5 + 3a6a9 −3a7a8,
r5 = 9δa5 −a24a5 + a3a25 + 6a7a9 −6a28.
We refer to Appendix A for the meaning of each of these generators.Strikingly, the complicated deﬁning relation of C32 with the help of the deﬁningrelations of C[C3] can be rewritten easily (see [28]):
a221 + 4a315
27 −1
27(r3r5 −r24) −1
18(a3r21 −2a4r1r2 + a5r22) = 0.
For n = 4 the generators of C[C4] and C[Com4] are exactly a1, . . . , a14, since theother generators of C42 contain commutators inside their trace function. The idealof the deﬁning relations for the coordinate ring of the fourth Calogero-Moser spaceappears to be generated by 12 relations, while for the invariant commuting vari-ety there are 15 relations [13]. We will see as an application of knowing the fulldescription of C42, how one can deduce the presentation of C[C4] and C[Com4] inSection 4.
2.6. Poisson algebra structure on Cn2. Let us consider the symplectic form
ω((X1, X2) , (Y1, Y2)) = Tr(X1Y2 −X2Y1).
on the pairs of matrices Mn × Mn ∼= T ∗(Mn). This form endows C[Mn × Mn]with a Poisson algebra structure by
{f, g} = ω(Xf, Xg),f, g ∈C[Mn × Mn].
Since the symplectic form is GLn-invariant, this induces the algebra Cn2 with aPoisson algebra structure. Nevertheless, a more robust approach is needed to as-certain the value of the Poisson bracket on speciﬁc generators. For that, let usconsider the two-dimensional vector space V = Cx ⊕Cy and deﬁne the followingsymplectic form on it
ω(x, y) = −ω(y, x) = 1,ω(x, x) = ω(y, y) = 0.
There is a Leibniz algebra structure [22] on the free noncommutative C-algebra Rgenerated by two elements x and y, deﬁned as follows:
{u1 · · · up, v1 · · · vq} =X
1≤i≤p1≤j≤q
ω(ui, vj)ui+1 · · · upu1 · · · ui−1vj+1 · · · vqv1 · · · vj−1,
invariants of pairs of matrices. The trace map deﬁned as follows (see [17])
tr: N →Cn2
xk1yl1 · · · xkmylm 7→ (X, Y ) 7→Tr(Xk1Y l1 · · · XkmY lm)
is a well-deﬁned Lie algebra homomorphism, which equips us with tools to computethe brackets on Cn2, turning the later to a Poisson algebra. Using this approach,an alternative way to establish the deﬁning relation of Cn2 for n = 3 was oﬀeredin [16].
2.7. Necklaces. A necklace in N is formed by equivalence classes of cyclic permu-tations of words in a 2-letter alphabet and, as a standard consideration, we shalluse as representative the biggest one with respect to the alphabetical order. Theusual degree lexicographical order in the space of two letter words induces a degreelexicographical order in the space of necklaces by comparing the representative wordof their respective equivalence class.
Deﬁnition 2.8. A necklace is said to be CHn if at least one of the words in itsequivalence class contains the same subword n times consecutively.
Deﬁnition 2.9. For a ﬁxed bidegree (r, s), we say that a pair of necklaces (w1, w2)is a breaking pair if it satisﬁes the following properties:• The sum of their bidegrees is exactly (r + 1, s + 1),• The ﬁrst one has at least degree 2 and it is smaller with respect the degreelexicographical order,• If the degree of the ﬁrst necklace is 2, then the second necklace is CHn,• The trace of at least one of them is not a term in the linear expansion ofthe minimal set of generators.
These pairs will be actively used to compute the value of the algebraic expres-sions of the traces of necklaces that are not CH4.For instance, for n = 4 inbidegree (3, 2) the pair (B2, A4B) is a breaking pair, but the pair (A2B, ABAB) isnot, since Tr(A2B) is exactly a7 and Tr(ABAB) appears in the linear expansionof a15.
3. Description of the algorithmic approach
3.1. Overview. Let us sketch the general idea of our procedure. First, we shallinductively obtain the unique description of the trace values of all necklaces ofdegree less or equal than 11 in terms of the generators from Appendix A. We shall dothis using the Cayley-Hamilton theorem for CH4 when it is possible, and breakingpairs when it is not. With this information we shall obtain the complete descriptionof the Poisson adjoint maps {a5, −} and {a6, −} on the generators a3, . . . , a32.Then, starting in degree 12, the approach above will give us the description ofeach trace of necklace modulo relations. Whenever a new relation emerges, it isincorporated to the ideal of relations together with its Poisson bracket with a5and a6. Using the already known Hilbert series, we can stop the computation whenthe full dimension is reached and shift to the next step.In this way, we can obtain almost the whole ideal of relations. The last piece ofthe puzzle will be unraveled by a careful exploration of the central elements of theNecklace Lie algebra.
While ﬁnding the value of the bracket of two necklaces in terms of generic matri-ces is very fast, when they are replaced by their traceless versions this computationcan be far more costly by the big amount of substitutions that have to be made.Because of this, it is recommended that anytime a bracket is computed its valueshould be stored in the memory, since it will probably be used again in a higherdegree computation.
3.3. First non-trivial degree. To demonstrate our approach, we shall commencein degree n = 5, since up to degree 4 all the traces are simply linear combinationsof the generators.We start in bidegree (5, 0), where we only ﬁnd one expression, Tr(A5), whichcan be decomposed using the Cayley-Hamilton theorem and it is equal to 5
6a3a6.Similarly, in bidegree (4, 1) we get
Tr(A4B) = 1
2 Tr(A2) Tr(A2B) + 1
3 Tr(A3) Tr(AB)
= 1
2a3a7 + 1
3a4a6.
In bidegree (3, 2) things get more interesting. There are two traces, Tr(A3B2)and Tr(A2BAB) that are not CH4. In this bidegree, there is only one breakingpair: (B2, A4B). On one hand, the Poisson bracket of the traces of this pair is:
{Tr(B2), Tr(A4B)} = −4 Tr(A3B2) −4 Tr(A2BAB).
On the other hand,
{Tr(B2), Tr(A4B)} = {Tr(B2), 1
2 Tr(A2) Tr(A2B) + 1
3 Tr(A3) Tr(AB)}
= 4 Tr(AB) Tr(AB2) + 2 Tr(A2B) Tr(B2) + 2
3 Tr(A2) Tr(B3).
Equalizing both equations, together with the actual deﬁnition of the generator
a16 = Tr([A, B]2A) = −Tr(A3B2) + Tr(A2BAB),
we obtain that:
Tr(A3B2) = 1
12(a5a6 + 6a4a7 + 3a3a8 −6a16),
Tr(A2BAB) = 1
12(a5a6 + 6a4a7 + 3a3a8 + 6a16).
This completes the case n = 5, since the remaining expressions can be immedi-ately found by making use of the inner symmetry.
of CH4 necklaces are further substituted by their corresponding algebraic expressionon the generators.The properties of breaking pairs guarantee us that at least one of the Tr(wi) canbe substituted by an algebraic expression of lower terms, thus, by the generators.Then, by making these substitution before computing the bracket {Tr(w1), Tr(w2)},we obtain another expression just in lower degree terms.Equalizing both expressions, we obtain a linear equation where the variables aretraces of non-CH4 necklaces. Doing this for all breaking pairs results in a linearsystem of equations. Furthermore, if there is a generator ai in this bidegree, we addthe equation formed by its expansion as a linear combination of traces of necklaces.The solution of this completely determined system will give us the unique algebraicexpression of all traces of non-CH4 necklaces in terms of the generators. Then, wecontinue to (r −1, s + 1) recursively.Note that to eﬃciently compute these expressions it is not necessary to calculatethe linear equations for all breaking pairs. We can randomly choose one pair ata time and add the resulting corresponding equation one by one, until we reach acompletely determined system.
3.5. Higher degrees. Starting from degree 12 we know that relations will start tooccur. Consequently, the expressions of traces of necklaces will stop being unique,since they are modded by this ideal of relations. Whenever we have to save thesevalues, it does not matters which representative we choose. We will inductivelyconstruct the ideal I by gathering the relations that will appear in each step.The same process described above will now lead to an inconsistent system ofequations. It is an easy linear algebra exercise to ﬁnd the minimal set of polynomialson the generators that will be incorporated to I to make the system consistent.There is a special case to be considered and it is bidegree (n/2, n/2) for even n. Inthis case, all the breaking pairs are not enough to generate all the relations, whilstexactly one might be missing. The way to compute this extra needed equationcomes from a careful exploration of the center of the Necklace Lie algebra. Let usconsider the expression Tr([A, B]n/2). On one hand, we can expand it and substitutethe traces of the CH4 necklaces.On the other hand, we can use the Cayley-Hamilton theorem to break [A, B]n/2 into smaller degree terms, whose expressionson generators are already known.The equalization of both expansions will beincorporated to the system of equations.After obtaining all the relations in degree n, we compute the Hilbert series of Iand compare it with (2.2). If they do not coincide, we move to the next degree.
are not enough, we try to ﬁnd new polynomials coming from the Poisson bracketof a6 with the relations of bidegree (r −2, s + 1).Now, to compute the expressions of the traces of non-CH4 necklaces we canproceed in the following way. We select randomly one breaking pair at a time andwe consider the resulting equation from the procedure described before. Dependingon its situation with the previously obtained equations we do the following• If it is linearly dependent, we discard it.• If it is linearly independent and does not make the system incompatible,we add it.• If it makes the system incompatible, we compute the relation in terms ofthe generators, we incorporate it to I if it does not belong to it yet, andthen we discard it.When the system of equations reaches full rank and I has full dimension, we stopthe procedure.Note that if we are in bidegree (n/2, n/2) for even n, the ﬁrstequation to consider should be the special one coming from Tr([A, B]n/2).When we have all the relations up to degree 16, we found that we do not needto compute the expressions of the traces of necklaces any more. The consecutiveapplication of the Poisson bracket of a5 or a6 to the already obtained relations ﬁllsup the dimensions of our graded ideal. This releases us from making a huge amountof computations until 20, degree where the last new relation appears.
3.7. Outcome. After applying the procedure explained above, we obtained thefollowing data:The polynomial ideal I is generated by the 105 relations listed in the ancillaryﬁle. The maximum degree found in this set of generators is (10, 10). Furthermore,only 8 relations (also listed in the ancillary ﬁle) are needed to generate I under therepeated adjoint maps {a5, −} and {a6, −}. More precisely, three of them appearin bidegrees:(6, 6),(7, 7),(8, 8),directly from the expansion of the respective power of the commutator. The otherﬁve are in bidegrees:
(7, 5),(6, 6),(7, 6),(8, 6),(8, 7).
Therefore, we can state the main theorem:
Theorem 3.8. There is an isomorphism
C[C42] ∼= C[a1, a2] ⊗C[a3, . . . , a32]
IProof. With the help of any computer algebra system it is an easy computation tocheck that the 105 polynomials generating I are relations in C[C42]. Then, checkingthat the Hilbert series of I coincides with (2.2) proves the theorem.□
we could ﬁnd for this to be executed in a reasonable amount of time is the fol-lowing: Let ai, aj be of bidegree (ri, si) and (rj, sj), respectively. Then ai < ajwhenever (ri, si) is lower than (rj, sj) with respect to the lexicographical order.There are exactly three cases when we have two generators of the same bidegree,choosing a15 < a12, a21 < a19 and a27 < a25.The main reason for the high eﬃciency of this method is the ability to transitionfrom lower to higher degree relations via the Poisson structure. Previous approacheswere limited to generating relations within the same degree, and having to againfully decompose the problem when moving to a higher total grading. Since thehighest degree required is 20, the decomposition should be carried out up to thatlevel.However, with our method, the computation can stop at degree 16, thehighest among our 8 generating relations. In fact, not even the entire degree 16needs to be computed, as only one of the extra relations is missing, therefore, apartial analysis of bidegree (8, 8) suﬃces.
3.10. Hironaka decomposition for C42. After getting the full ideal of relations,to get the Hironaka decomposition of C42 becomes a much easier task. After anexamination of the modiﬁed denominator (2.3) of the Hilbert series, we chooseas primary invariants the 17 traces (2.4) denoted by a1, . . . , a15, a18, a20 in Ap-pendix A. Then, we compute a Gröbner basis with respect to the graded reverselexicographical order of the ideal generated by a1, . . . , a15, a18, a20 together withthe 105 relations obtained in Theorem 3.8. Finally, it is a matter of checking whichare the 48 normal monomials in this Gröbner basis.
Corollary 3.11. The algebra C42 is a free C[a1, . . . , a15, a18, a20]-module of rank 48,and a basis is listed in Appendix B.
4. Applications to the invariant commuting variety and theCalogero-Moser space
Since the invariant commuting variety is a subvariety of the variety of pairs ofmatrices with respect to conjugation, there is a surjective algebra homomorphismfrom Cn2 to C[Comn], for arbitrary n > 1. Therefore, we can attempt to leveragethe structure of Cn2 to obtain the complete description of C[Comn].If Cn2 and C[Comn] are isomorphic to the polynomial ideals C[a1, . . . , ak]/Iand C[a1, . . . , as]/J, respectively, where the ai represent the trace of some expres-sion, there is a well-deﬁned surjection C[a1, . . . , ak] →C[a1, . . . , as] sending anygenerator to its corresponding expression in the commuting variety. In other words,we obtain the following diagram:
0

,2 J
C[a1, . . . , ak]
/ / C[a1, . . . , as]
C[a1, . . . , ak]
I
/ / C[a1, . . . , as]
J
Note that all arrows are algebra homomorphisms, and furthermore, the lowerhorizontal arrow is also a Poisson algebra homomorphism.If we know the description of I and its induced morphism to J happens to be asurjection, we will obtain the full description of J. Let us examine what happensin the known cases:For n = 2, it is established that k = s = 5, hence the surjection in the middleis an isomorphism. Nevertheless, I = 0 but J = ⟨a24 −a3a5⟩, indicating that theinduced morphism between the ideals of relations can never be a surjection.When n = 3, it is known that k = 11 and s = 9 and the morphism in the middlesends each generator to itself, except the last two that are mapped to zero. In thiscase, I is the ideal generated by a single polynomial, while J is an ideal generatedby ﬁve polynomial relations [28]. Therefore, it is obvious that, again, the inducedmorphism is not a surjection.However, for n = 4 the number of relations increases signiﬁcantly, so the situationmay diﬀer. It is known that k = 32 while s = 14 and, moreover, the polynomialideal I is generated by 105 equations while the ideal J is generated by just 15(see [13]).Looking at the form of the generators in Appendix A, it is easy toguess the map—ai’s are mapped to themselves for all 1 ≤i ≤14 and to zerootherwise. Given that the rank of the Hironaka decomposition of C[Com4] is alreadyestablished [14], it is a straightforward exercise to verify that this map induces asurjection from I to J, recovering the description of J obtained in [13].In the case of Calogero-Moser spaces, things work in a similar fashion.Wecan construct a diagram as before, with the only variation being the image of thegenerators.For n = 2, the map is deﬁned identically, but J = ⟨a24 −a3a5 + 1⟩, so again, it isnot possible to recover J by this map.When n = 3, it is known that s = 9 and the map is deﬁned as follows: the ﬁrstnine generators are mapped to themselves while the last two go to the scalars −3and 2, respectively [28]. Once more, I is generated by just one relation, whereas Jis generated by ﬁve of them. Consequently, J cannot be recovered by this map.In the case of n = 4, the situation is analogous to that in the invariant commutingvariety; however, determining the morphism is more intricate. Motivated by theidentities that emerge when the pair of matrices is restricted to Calogero-Moserspace C4, it can be proved by similar methods of [28] that the generators are mappedas follows:
