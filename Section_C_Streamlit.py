The paper advances the state of the art by proposing a self-modeling diagnosis that dynamically constructs dependency graphs while considering finer granularities of network components."

    "logical_chain": "The article presents a comprehensive argumentation process that starts by identifying key challenges in diagnosing software-defined and virtualized network environments, leading to the proposal of a self-modeling framework that systematically constructs detailed dependency graphs necessary for effective diagnosis. The method enhances diagnosis granularity and automation while addressing the limitations of existing models, establishing a well-supported case for improving network resiliency through self-diagnosing capabilities."
