Table 2 AI elaborations on CHEERS 2022: Further guidance for reporting. Section/topic No. Further guidance for reporting Title Title 1 AI refers to algorithmic techniques that analyze large amounts of data for correlations and patterns and use these patterns to simulate the problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of the human mind. This does not include more traditional statistical techniques. If an intervention under evaluation uses AI to perform its function (eg, through algorithms embedded in a digital health technology), then an appropriate term such as \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d should be included in the study title. Abstract Abstract 2 The purpose of the intervention with an AI component (eg, to treat or diagnose, drive clinical management, inform clinical management) and the way the AI works (eg, deep neural networks for image processing and not traditional statistical techniques) should be reported in the abstract. Methods Comparators 7 (a) The classification and risk tier of the AI-based intervention can relate to existing regulatory frameworks, such as the SaMD framework proposed by the IMDRF, and the evidence standards framework for digital health technologies proposed by the NICE. \u2022 The SaMD framework classifies digital health technologies by their intended purpose (ie, for critical, serious or nonserious situations) and significance on the healthcare decision (ie, treat or diagnose, drive clinical management, or inform clinical management). \u2022 The evidence standards framework for digital health technologies defines tiers based on the potential risk to service users or the system (ie, tier A, no direct patient, health or care outcomes; tier B, interventions to assist peoples\u2019 personal health and wellbeing; tier C, interventions for treating, diagnosing, or guiding care choices). (b) The way the AI works (eg, deep neural networks for image processing) should be reported. (c and d) An AI component that is \u201clocked\u201d or static does not change over time, whereas an adaptive AI may continue to learn from data and change over time, potentially affecting outcomes (this may be captured in the evaluation, or the evaluation may focus on a static version of the intervention at a point in time). (e) The purpose of the intervention should be reported. (f) Intended user(s) could include patients, clinicians, healthcare providers, or other agents. (g) Additional requirements could include specific consent processes or staff training. (h) Potential benefits could include clinical effects on health outcomes and economic effects on resource use or system efficiency. Selection of outcomes 11 An outcome measure is used to quantify the extent to which an intervention has an effect. For example, a study may measure effectiveness (benefits and harms) in terms of changes in health outcomes, diagnostic outcomes (such as improved accuracy), process outcomes (eg, faster decision making), or several outcomes simultaneously. Measurement of outcomes 12 Assumptions regarding the effect of the AI intervention, such as the use of arbitrary or exploratory input values, should be transparently reported. Their theoretical or scientific basis should be explained. Measurement and valuation of resources and costs 14 The purchase cost of an intervention with an AI component may include a purchase price and other components, such as the developer implementing the AI into practice or maintaining it over time. There may be other relevant costs to the healthcare system relating to implementation of an AI intervention. Rationale and description of model 16 A model may be used in a health economic evaluation to estimate the cost-effectiveness of an intervention. Explain if a particular model structure or programming approach, such as individual patient simulation, has been chosen to characterize the AI intervention appropriately. Discussion Study findings, limitations, generalizability, and current knowledge 26 There may be ethical and equity issues associated with AI that are relevant for decision makers alongside the cost-effectiveness results. Biases may include, for example, the AI intervention being developed using a training data set that is not representative of the population of interest.

Table 3 AI extensions to CHEERS 2022: further guidance for reporting. Section/topic No. Further guidance for reporting Methods User autonomy AI 1 How directly the intervention affects clinical care, and the extent of user autonomy from its outputs, may be defined in the context of existing regulatory frameworks (eg, SaMD): \u2022 \u201cLeads to direct care action\u201d could include the intervention being used to definitive diagnosis, or itself being a treatment. \u2022 \u201cDrives clinical management\u201d means the intervention aids treatment, diagnosis or decision making in a supportive way. \u2022 \u201cInforms clinical management\u201d means no direct care action is used, for example informing users of options or providing information. Measurement of AI effect AI 2 This item relates to the evidence informing the impact of the AI intervention. For interventions that directly affect care (eg, treatments), these may be clinical trials to evaluate efficacy. For interventions that drive or inform care (eg, diagnostic algorithms), these may be diagnostic studies that report predictive accuracy. In the absence of evidence, analyst assumptions may be required. This is not the same as \u201ctraining data,\u201d which an AI component might learn from during development. Measurement of AI learning over time AI 3 An intervention with a \u201clearning\u201d (adaptive) AI component may become more effective over time as it learns from data collected during its use. How this learning effect was measured should be reported or signposted using a suitable citation. Development of AI component AI 4 How the AI component of an intervention was developed should be described or signposted using a suitable citation (eg, a completed TRIPOD-AI checklist for prediction model development). Validation of AI component AI 5 Similar to traditional statistical techniques, the internal and external validity of the development of the AI intervention (including, for example, its predictive model) should be described, or signposted using a suitable citation (eg, a completed TRIPOD-AI checklist for prediction model validation). Health benefit AI 6 \u201cHealth benefit\u201d refers to the way an intervention affects health outcomes, which can be quantified to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness. AI interventions may have different mechanisms by which they are expected to generate health benefits for the people who use them. For example, an AI-based digital health technology designed to inform clinical management (ie, with no direct care action) may have an indirect effect on health outcomes. Population differences AI 7 The data used to develop the intervention\u2019s AI component may be referred to as its \u201ctraining\u201d data set. This may differ from the study population that was used to examine the beneficial impact of the intervention compared with alternative options (eg, clinical trials to evaluate efficacy or diagnostic studies to evaluate predictive accuracy). Modeling of AI learning over time AI 8 An intervention with a \u201clearning\u201d (adaptive) AI component may become more effective or accurate over time as it learns from data collected during its use. Any modeling assumptions to capture this should be transparently reported. Results Impact of AI uncertainty AI 9 Uncertainty is usually characterized as random error, parameter uncertainty or structural uncertainty. The AI nature of an intervention may contribute disproportionately to one or more of these types of uncertainty. AI-specific uncertainties and their potential implications on study results should be reported. Discussion Implementation of AI AI 10 Requirements for implementation may include, for example, necessary software that may be distinct from standard clinical equipment, or a new data acquisition process. Barriers to implementing a new technology may be relevant for decision makers alongside the cost-effectiveness results.

National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Level 1A City Tower Manchester M1 4BT United Kingdom Objectives Economic evaluations (EEs) are commonly used by decision makers to understand the value of health interventions. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS 2022) provide reporting guidelines for EEs. Healthcare systems will increasingly see new interventions that use artificial intelligence (AI) to perform their function. We developed Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards for Interventions that use AI (CHEERS-AI) to ensure EEs of AI-based health interventions are reported in a transparent and reproducible manner. Methods Potential CHEERS-AI reporting items were informed by 2 published systematic literature reviews of EEs and a contemporary update. A Delphi study was conducted using 3 survey rounds to elicit multidisciplinary expert views on 26 potential items, through a 9-point Likert rating scale and qualitative comments. An online consensus meeting was held to finalize outstanding reporting items. A digital health patient group reviewed the final checklist from a patient perspective. Results A total of 58 participants responded to survey round 1, 42, and 31 of whom responded to rounds 2 and 3, respectively. Nine participants joined the consensus meeting. Ultimately, 38 reporting items were included in CHEERS-AI. They comprised the 28 original CHEERS 2022 items, plus 10 new AI-specific reporting items. Additionally, 8 of the original CHEERS 2022 items were elaborated on to ensure AI-specific nuance is reported. Conclusions CHEERS-AI should be used when reporting an EE of an intervention that uses AI to perform its function. CHEERS-AI will help decision makers and reviewers to understand important AI-specific details of an intervention, and any implications for the EE methods used and cost-effectiveness conclusions. Keywords artificial intelligence CHEERS checklist health economic evaluation reporting guideline Introduction Healthcare decision makers, health technology assessment (HTA) agencies and reimbursement and pricing authorities often examine the cost-effectiveness of health interventions, alongside clinical effectiveness and other relevant considerations. Cost-effectiveness estimates are typically informed by an economic evaluation (EE), conducted alongside a clinical study or using a decision model, and indicate the likely economic value of an intervention compared with the most appropriate comparator(s). The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS 2022) provide researchers with a framework for reporting EEs. 1 By reporting their EE using the CHEERS 2022 checklist, authors should provide at least a minimum standard of transparency and reproducibility. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is an area of rapid development, with an increasing number of AI-enabled healthcare technologies reaching late stage development and achieving market authorization as medical devices. 2 AI essentially describes the use of computer algorithms that perform tasks normally associated with human intelligence. 3 Decision-making organizations are likely to increasingly be presented with health interventions that use AI systems, such as recent examples to analyze chest X-rays 4 and assist radiotherapy treatment planning. 5 This is reflected by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recently updating its framework for digital health technologies to include evidence standards for AI-based technologies. 3 Given that AI-driven capabilities are often complex and may affect the cost-effectiveness of the intervention, it is important that the methods used to evaluate AI-based interventions are clearly reported. A systematic review of EEs of AI-based interventions, 6 and a recent update of the review, 7 both concluded that advancements in AI appear to be accelerating quicker than the practices of EE. There appears to be notable reporting gaps in published EEs, such as how the AI intervention works, including its role in and influence on care pathways. These are likely to be different to commonly evaluated health technologies, such as medicines. We considered that an extension to CHEERS 2022 for the evaluation of AI-based interventions may be warranted to ensure that key information about the AI component(s) and implications for the EE are adequately reported. This study reports the development of the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards for Interventions that use AI (CHEERS-AI) reporting guideline extension. CHEERS-AI is intended to extend the original CHEERS statement, by drawing out important nuances relating to AI that might otherwise be missed and introducing new AI-specific reporting items in situations which are appropriate. The key intended audience for CHEERS-AI is likely to be health economists who are reporting an EE of an AI-based intervention. Additionally, healthcare decision makers (and the HTA agencies that support them), journal editors, and peer reviewers may find that CHEERS-AI provides useful AI-specific review criteria when assessing the suitability of a published EE. This study has been supported by Next-Generation HTA (HTx), which is a Horizon 2020 project supported by the European Union, lasting for 5 years from January 2019 onward. Methods The development of CHEERS-AI followed the methodology used to develop CHEERS 2022 1 and recent AI extensions to standards for reporting clinical trial protocols 8 and results 9 and the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research guidance. 10 , 11 The study record was published on the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research website, 12 and the study protocol was published in full elsewhere. 13 Ethical approval was granted by the Newcastle University Research Ethics Committee (28568/2022). Our methodology consisted of 3 phases with multiple steps. The initiation phase involved (1) convening an expert steering group, (2) creating a longlist of potential reporting items, and (3) agreeing on a shorter list of potential items. The development phase involved 4) a 3-round consensus-building exercise using the Delphi method, 14 (5) a consensus meeting, and (6) engagement with a patient expert group. The finalization phase involved (7) piloting the CHEERS-AI reporting items and (8) final steering group ratification of all items. Initiation Phase Steering group A multidisciplinary steering group (n = 17) was convened to steward the development process and provide expert oversight. The steering group included expertise in health economics (n = 9), HTA (n = 8), AI (n = 5), clinical practice (n = 2), patient advocacy (n = 1), and a member of the CHEERS 2022 Task Force (see Appendix Table 1 in Supplemental Materials found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2024.05.006). A prespecified minimum of 50% of steering group members was required for quorate decision making. Identifying candidate items Two recent systematic reviews of EEs of AI-based health interventions and their 41 constituent studies were reviewed 6 , 7 by 4 steering group members (A.Z., C.H., J.E., and Z.P.). The reviewers generated a longlist of potential AI-specific reporting items based on their interpretation of the published EEs. This longlist was reviewed and discussed by the full steering group to reach consensus about those that should proceed to the Delphi study. If there was disagreement about a potential item, the group included the item in the Delphi study. Development Phase Delphi study The steering group nominated relevant stakeholders to invite to participate in the Delphi study based on their expertise and professional networks. Stakeholders included methodologists (A.I. and E.E.), healthcare decision makers (HTA and payers), healthcare professionals, journal editors, research funders, patient advocates, ethicists, and representatives of the pharmaceutical and health technology industries. The 119 identified stakeholders were invited by email to participate in a three-round survey process and encouraged to share the invitation with their networks. The Delphi method was administered between May 2023 and September 2023. The response time was 3 weeks for survey rounds 1 and 2, and 2 weeks for survey round 3. Two reminders were sent before each round closed. Participants were asked to score the importance of each candidate item on a 9-point Likert scale, from 1 (not important) to 9 (very important). For each item, respondents could provide qualitative comments about the proposed text and description, such as suggestions to improve the wording or merge items. After each survey round, the steering group convened and discussed the quantitative and qualitative findings. The group implemented minor wording changes, and more substantial changes such as merging items, in which they were considered sensible without altering the intended meaning of the proposed items. Consistent with the CHEERS 2022 Delphi study, 1 , 11 , 15 , 16 items with 70% of expert ratings below 7 in survey round 1 were excluded. Items with a mean score of 7 or higher after round 2 were included, and items with a mean score of 4 or less were excluded. Remaining items, with mean scores higher than 4 but less than 7, proceeded to round 3. After round 3, the steering group would include items that scored 5 or higher, except any that received multiple conflicting qualitative comments. Any such items would be discussed during a consensus meeting with a subgroup of Delphi participants. The steering group would make the final decision about them. Consensus meeting A subgroup of Delphi study participants reflecting the various stakeholder groups and countries was invited to join a consensus meeting on 2 October 2023. The purpose was to discuss the results of survey round 3, including outstanding contentious items, and ratify all items that had been accepted after round 2. Minor wording changes to reporting items were implemented provided they received the approval of at least 50% of the Delphi study participants in attendance. Patient involvement To ensure we had sufficient patient involvement in the development of CHEERS-AI, the reporting items were shared with the Digital Advisory Group of patient advocates at the European Organisation for Rare Diseases (EURORDIS) to elicit a patient perspective about their presentation and clarity. Finalization Phase Pilot exercise The CHEERS-AI reporting guideline extension was piloted by 5 members of the steering group (A.C., A.Z., D.S., S.P., and T.S.A.) on a sample of 9 published EEs of AI-based interventions identified across 2 systematic reviews (6 and 7). The purpose of the pilot exercise was to identify any unclear, ambiguous, or challenging items when applying CHEERS-AI in practice. Recommended changes would be implemented if they received approval by the steering group. Steering group ratification The steering group convened on 19 October 2023 to discuss CHEERS-AI items after the Delphi study and consensus meeting and continued to review any changes in response to the patient group\u2019s review and pilot exercise until December 2023. The steering group collectively made the final decision about any changes and ratified the final CHEERS-AI reporting guideline extension. Results Initiation Phase The long list of potential reporting items contained 30 items. The steering group agreed that 26 items were suitable for inclusion in the Delphi study. They were classified as either elaborations on a pre-existing CHEERS 2022 reporting item or extensions to CHEERS 2022, as follows: \u2022 An elaboration adds AI-specific context to a \u2018parent\u2019 CHEERS 2022 reporting item. It indicates that the existing parent item may be sufficient for EEs of AI interventions if the researcher is diligent, but important AI-related nuances need to be pointed out to ensure they are always reported. \u2022 An extension is an entirely new reporting item that goes beyond elaborating on an existing CHEERS 2022 item. It indicates important AI-specific information that must be reported when evaluating AI-based health interventions to ensure transparency and replicability. Development Phase In the Delphi study, a total of 58 individuals participated in the first survey, with health economists (53%, 31/58), HTA professionals (26%, 15/58), and AI experts (17%, 10/58) being the best represented stakeholders. The second survey round generated responses from 42 participants (72% retention, 42/58), of whom 31 also responded to the third survey round (74% retention, 31/42). Participants were based in 17 countries across Europe, North America, Asia, and Oceania. Aggregated information about participants\u2019 expertise and location in each survey round is provided in the Appendix Table 2 in Supplemental Materials found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2024.05.006. Of the 26 potential reporting items in survey round 1, none were excluded but several were merged to avoid repetition, meaning that 18 potential items proceeded to round 2. Thirteen items met the criteria for inclusion after round 2. Five items proceeded to round 3, of which 1 remained contentious following the survey and was discussed extensively at the subsequent consensus meeting. A subgroup of 9 Delphi study participants joined the consensus meeting after survey round 3. Seven nonvoting steering group members also attended the meeting to facilitate and contribute to the discussion. One major change was recommended by participant to exclude an extension item because an existing CHEERS 2022 item (#16) was considered to be sufficient. However, this recommendation was in conflict with the quantitative results from round 3. Therefore, the item proceeded for further steering group deliberation to find a resolution. As a compromise, the item was reclassified as an elaboration on CHEERS 2022 item 16 and reworded to improve its specificity. The EURORDIS Digital Advisory Group of 13 patient advocates provided positive feedback about the completeness and convenience of the CHEERS-AI reporting items. Consequently, 2 items were subject to minor wording changes to improve their clarity without altering the intended meaning. Finalization Phase For the pilot exercise, to test using CHEERS-AI in practice, 9 published EE studies 17-25 were selected at random. In general, the checklist was considered to be easy to use and understand. However, for 5 CHEERS-AI items, none of the EEs included in the pilot were found to adequately report them (see Appendix Tables 3 and 4 in Supplemental Materials found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2024.05.006). This was considered to indicate reporting limitations in the evidence base, rather than a limitations of CHEERS-AI. Therefore, no substantive changes were made following the pilot exercise. CHEERS-AI Reporting Standards Table 1 presents the CHEERS-AI reporting items. Each item has a title, number, and description explaining what the author of an EE should report. AI-specific elaborations on a pre-existing CHEERS 2022 item are presented to the right of the corresponding item. New AI-specific items that might not otherwise be captured by CHEERS 2022 are included in their own rows and are denoted by \u201cAI\u201d item numbers (AI 1, AI 2, and so on). For each item, the authors of an EE are expected to indicate the manuscript section, paragraph, or line that contains the required information. For AI-specific elaboration and extension items, further guidance for reporting is provided in Tables 2 and 3 , respectively, including additional information\u2014such as the rationale for the item and definitions of key terms used in it\u2014that may help users to complete the checklist. Examples of suitable reporting of CHEERS-AI items, identified during our pilot exercise, are provided as Appendix Tables 3 and 4 in Supplemental Materials found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2024.05.006. Discussion Standardized reporting of the use of AI in healthcare is needed as HTA and decision-making organizations are increasingly presented with AI-enabled interventions. There are recent advances in this area for development (Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis-Artificial Intelligence [TRIPOD-AI]) and validation (Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool-Artificial Intelligence [PROBAST-AI]) studies, 26 trial protocols (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials\u2013Artificial Intelligence [SPIRIT-AI] 8 ), and trial reports (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials\u2013Artificial Intelligence [CONSORT-AI] 9 ). Those checklists should enhance the reporting of the development and assessment of AI health interventions, and now we have developed the CHEERS-AI reporting guideline extension to do the same for EEs. Our reporting standards were developed using a very similar methodological approach to CHEERS 2022, including a Delphi study to identify multidisciplinary consensus, stewarded by an expert steering group. Researchers conducting EEs of AI-based health interventions can use CHEERS-AI to ensure that AI-specific nuances and implications are reported or cited in a transparent and reproducible way. The importance of an AI extension to CHEERS 2022 was highlighted during the development process, including through qualitative responses during the Delphi study. Respondents noted as follows: first, unlike medicines, AI interventions often involve diagnostic or clinical decision support tools, which require that researchers think carefully about the mechanism by which the intervention affects care pathways, costs, and health outcomes (item 7 elaboration, items AI 1 and AI 6). Some participants suggested that several CHEERS-AI items could apply more broadly to EEs of diagnostic technologies with or without AI, perhaps reflecting that AI in healthcare is currently dominated by diagnostic interventions, rather than therapeutics. Second, participants explained that CHEERS-AI can help to clarify costs associated with AI-based interventions (item 14 elaboration), clearly indicating when they are exploratory (eg, Van Leeuwen et al 24 and Gomez et al 27 ) or not captured (eg, Szymanski et al 28 ) because it is unlikely that predictive algorithms underpinning such interventions will be free to use in practice. The use of such interventions may incur one-off or recurring acquisition costs and significant implementation costs for healthcare providers if they cause disruption to care pathways. Furthermore, the potential for AI health interventions to learn from data over time and become more effective has not been observed to date, and our pilot exercise\u2014conducted to stress test the CHEERS-AI checklist in the way it might be applied by reviewers\u2014identified no EEs that reported on this. Indeed, a total of 5 items were found to be inadequately or not reported by EEs in our pilot exercise, and we believe this further demonstrates the need for CHEERS-AI to improve the reporting of such studies. In the context of AI interventions learning over time, items AI 3 (\u201cMeasurement of AI learning over time\u201d) and AI 8 (\u201cModeling of AI learning over time\u201d) are likely to be enabling CHEERS-AI to accommodate future advances in AI health technologies. In the meantime, version control, including how often adaptive algorithms are updated and whether those updates are included in the purchase cost of the AI intervention, remains an important reporting consideration. The development of CHEERS-AI had a few noteworthy limitations. First, similar to any consensus-generation process, it was limited by the expertise of the participants involved. Our Delphi group (n = 58) was smaller than some Delphi studies of AI reporting, such as CONSORT-AI (n = 103), 9 but bigger than others, including the comparable extension to CHEERS 2022 for value of information analysis (CHEERS-VOI) (n = 30). 29 Our steering group (n = 17) was also relatively large (vs CHEERS 2022, n = 15 1 and CHEERS-VOI, n = 10 29 ) and provided multidisciplinary expert input throughout. However, it remains possible that experts with valuable complementary insights may not have been reached. Second, when reviewing the results of survey round 1, it became clear that many high scores\u2014indicating that items should be included in CHEERS-AI\u2014were accompanied by less-positive qualitative comments, suggesting that the items were broadly important but were not necessarily specific to AI interventions or were already captured by CHEERS 2022. This misunderstanding was rectified in survey round 2, in which participants were clearly advised that high scores should be reserved for items that were considered important to report in an EE of an AI-based intervention and may not be captured by CHEERS 2022. Furthermore, although the checklist has a dual purpose of being used by both authors and reviewers of EEs, it was piloted only in the latter context of reviewing the reporting of published evaluations, rather than guiding the reporting of a primary EE study. Because CHEERS 2022 is now often used by systematic reviewers to grade the reporting quality of identified EE studies, this can be a beneficial secondary purpose of CHEERS-AI. Finally, although some CHEERS-AI items are likely to be \u2018future-proofing\u2019 the reporting standards against future developments of AI in healthcare, the authors recognize that this is a rapidly evolving field. We consider that major developments should be monitored and, if needed, CHEERS-AI may need to be amended or expanded over time. Conclusion To date, the reporting quality of EEs of AI-enabled health technologies has been highly variable. The development of a reporting extension that supplements CHEERS 2022, to guide the reporting and reviewing of EEs of AI-enabled health interventions (CHEERS-AI), represents an important addition to the tools available to support the conduct of such evaluations. CHEERS-AI contains all pre-existing CHEERS 2022 items, including 8 elaborations to draw out important AI-specific nuances, and 10 entirely new reporting items. The use of CHEERS-AI will ensure that important AI-specific details about the intervention and their potential implications for cost-effectiveness conclusions are appropriately reported and described. We recommend that CHEERS-AI is used by researchers, editors, and reviewers conducting or assessing such EEs for dissemination or HTA purposes.

The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS 2022) provide reporting guidelines for EEs. Healthcare systems will increasingly see new interventions that use artificial intelligence (AI) to perform their function. We developed Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards for Interventions that use AI (CHEERS-AI) to ensure EEs of AI-based health interventions are reported in a transparent and reproducible manner. Methods Potential CHEERS-AI reporting items were informed by 2 published systematic literature reviews of EEs and a contemporary update. A Delphi study was conducted using 3 survey rounds to elicit multidisciplinary expert views on 26 potential items, through a 9-point Likert rating scale and qualitative comments. An online consensus meeting was held to finalize outstanding reporting items. A digital health patient group reviewed the final checklist from a patient perspective. Results A total of 58 participants responded to survey round 1, 42, and 31 of whom responded to rounds 2 and 3, respectively. Nine participants joined the consensus meeting. Ultimately, 38 reporting items were included in CHEERS-AI. They comprised the 28 original CHEERS 2022 items, plus 10 new AI-specific reporting items. Additionally, 8 of the original CHEERS 2022 items were elaborated on to ensure AI-specific nuance is reported. Conclusions CHEERS-AI should be used when reporting an EE of an intervention that uses AI to perform its function. CHEERS-AI will help decision makers and reviewers to understand important AI-specific details of an intervention, and any implications for the EE methods used and cost-effectiveness conclusions.", "openArchiveArticle": "false", "prism:coverDate": "2024-09-30", "openaccessUserLicense": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098301524023660", "dc:creator": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "Elvidge, Jamie"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hawksworth, Claire"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Av\u015far, Tuba Sayg\u0131n"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Zemplenyi, Antal"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Chalkidou, Anastasia"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Petrou, Stavros"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Petyk\u00f3, Zsuzsanna"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Srivastava, Divya"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Chandra, Gunjan"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Delaye, Julien"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Denniston, Alastair"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Gomes, Manuel"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Knies, Saskia"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Nousios, Petros"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Siirtola, Pekka"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Wang, Junfeng"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Dawoud, Dalia"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Arbour, Sylvie"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Asche, Carl"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Ashurst, Carolyn"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Balkanyi, Laszlo"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Bennett, Hayley"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Boros, Gerzson"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Boyce, Rebecca"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Carswell, Chris"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Chhatwal, Jagpreet"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Ciani, Oriana"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Collins, Gary"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Dawson, David"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Vanness, David"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Di Bidino, Rossella"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Faulding, Susan"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Felizzi, Federico"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Haig, Madeleine"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hawkins, James"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Hiligsmann, Mika\u00ebl"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Holst-Kristensen, Annette Willemoes"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Isla, Julian"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Koffijberg, Erik"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Kostyuk, Alexander"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Krief, Noemi"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Lee, Dawn"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Lee, Karen"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Lundin, Douglas"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Markiewicz-Barreaux, Katarzyna"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Mauskopf, Josephine"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Moons, Karel"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "N\u00e9meth, Bertalan"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Petrova, Guenka"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Pwu, Raoh-Fang (Jasmine)"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Rejon-Parrilla, Juan Carlos"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Rogers, Gabriel"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Sampson, Chris"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Springborg, Astrid Aaen"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Steuten, Lotte"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Sutherland, Eric"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Suutala, Jaakko"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Theisen, Daniel"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Thompson, Alexander"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "van Gemert-Pijnen, Lisette"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Walker, Thomas"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "Wilson, Ed"}], "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098301524023660"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@rel": "scidir", "@href": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098301524023660"}], "dc:format": "application/json", "openaccessType": "Full", "pii": "S1098-3015(24)02366-0", "prism:volume": "27", "prism:publisher": "International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research, Inc.
